//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
let friendsName = ["Kinza","Alishna","Aiza","Warisha"];
let i=0;
for(i;i<friendsName.length;i++){
    console.log("Asalam o alikum ,Good Afternoon",friendsName[i]);
