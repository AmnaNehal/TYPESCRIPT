//our Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
var Vehicles = ["Tesla Model S", "Ducati Monster", "Boeing 747", "Yamaha YZF-R1"];
Vehicles.forEach(function (vehicle) {
    console.log("I would like to own ", vehicle);
});
