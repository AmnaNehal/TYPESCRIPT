//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function createCar(manufacturer:string,model_name:string,options: { [key: string]: any }={}):{ manufacturer: string, model_name: string, [key: string]: any }{
    let car ={
        manufacturer,
        model_name,
        ...options
    }
    return car;
}

let car1 = createCar('Toyota', 'Camry', { color: 'Blue', sunroof: true });
let car2 = createCar('Ford', 'Mustang', { color: 'Red', engine: 'V8' });


console.log(car1);
console.log(car2);
